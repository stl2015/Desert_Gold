# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Projects

Here are the projects I finished for Udacity AI Nanodegree.

### American Sign Language Recognizer (probabilistic model)

Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of this dataset to try and identify individual words from test sequences.

In addition, incorporated Statistical Language Models (SLMs) that capture the conditional probability of particular sequences of words occurring. HMM + SLM were implemented in Viterbi like algorithm.

### Build A Game-Playing Agent (Isolation Game)

Built a Game-Playing agent that defeats opponents in Isolation. Learned about advanced Game-Playing techniques such as Minimax, Iterative Deepening, and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

### Planning Search

This project solved deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using a planning search agent. With progression search algorithms, optimal plans for each problem will be computed.  Unlike the navigation problem, there is no simple distance heuristic to aid the agent. 

### Sudoku

Implemented two extensions of sudoku solver. Practice: constrain satisfaction propagation.

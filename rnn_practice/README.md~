# Recurrent Neural Networks course project: time series prediction and text generation


#### Step 1:  Implement a function to window time series
| Window time series data. | returns the proper windowed version of input time series of proper dimension listed in the notebook.  |


#### Step 2: Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform regression

| Build an RNN model to perform regression. |  constructs an RNN model in keras with LSTM module of dimension defined in the notebook.        |


#### Step 3: Clean up a large text corpus

| Find and remove all non-english or punctuation characters from input text data.  removes all non-english / non-punctuation characters.  |


#### Step 4: Implement a function to window a large text corpus

| Implement a function to window input text data| returns the proper windowed version of input text of proper dimension listed in the notebook.  |


#### Step 5: Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform multiclass classification

| Build an RNN model to perform multiclass classification. |  constructs an RNN model in keras with LSTM module of dimension defined in the notebook.        |


#### Step 6: Generate text using a fully trained RNN model and a variety of input sequences
| Generate text using a trained RNN classifier.   | presents examples of generated text from a trained RNN module.  The majority of this generated text should consist of real english words. |
